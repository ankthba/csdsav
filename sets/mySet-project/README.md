# MySet Project

This project implements a custom `MySet` class in Java, which provides basic set operations such as adding, removing, and checking for elements. The project includes a driver class to demonstrate the functionality of the `MySet` class.

## Features

- **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the set.
- **Clear**: Removes all elements from the set.

## Compilation and Running Instructions

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd mySet-project
   ```

2. **Compile the Java files**:
   ```
   javac -d bin src/Pd5AnikethBandlamudiMySet.java
   ```

3. **Run the driver class**:
   ```
   java -cp bin Pd5AnikethBandlamudiMySet
   ```

## Usage
